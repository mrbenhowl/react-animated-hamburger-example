# React animated hamburger example
Hamburger menu built using React and CSS (transitions) without images or SVGs, just lovely good old/new CSS.
Example uses css-modules and postcss-cssnext.

To build locally: 
1. *yarn* or *npm install*
2. *yarn build* or *npm run build*
3. fire up that browser and point to index.html
4. The dist/ folder is committed so you can skip steps 1 and 2 and go straight to step 3 because there isn't any need to do steps 1 and 2 really (so that begs the question why did I include them, ah well).
